GITHUB ESSENTIALS CERTIFICATION COURSE NOTES (LINKEDIN LEARNING)

Video 1:

Here are the key takeaways from the "Git for version control" video:

Version Control: Git helps you keep track of different versions of your code without creating multiple files like Code1, Code2, etc.
Commits: Instead of creating new files, you create commits in Git to save specific versions of your code, allowing you to easily revert to previous versions.
Local and Cloud Storage: Git can be used locally on your computer, and you can also use a Git provider like GitHub to store your version history in the cloud, ensuring you don't lose your code if something happens to your device

Video 2 :

Here are the key takeaways from the "Git to collaborate" video:

Collaboration: Git allows multiple people to work on the same file by sharing and updating code through a Git provider.
Version Updates: Changes made by one person can be pulled by others to keep everyone up-to-date with the latest version.
Merge Conflicts: Git can intelligently merge changes from different users, but manual checks are needed if changes are made to the same part of the file.
Video 3 :

Here are the key takeaways from the "Open source" video:

Open Source Definition: Open-source software means the code is publicly available for anyone to see, use, and modify.
Community Collaboration: The community can work together on the code, reporting bugs, adding features, and making changes.
Branching: To avoid disrupting the main code, especially if it's running in production, developers create branches to work on changes separately.
Merging Changes: Once changes are tested and reviewed, they can be merged back into the main code through a pull request, ensuring stability and consistency.



Video 4 :

Here are the key takeaways from the "Use a Git provider" video:

Git Push: This command is used to push committed files from your local repository to a remote repository, making them accessible from other devices or by other people.
Git Pull: This command retrieves files from the remote repository to your local repository and local folder, ensuring you have the latest version of the files.
Local vs. Remote: Only committed files are pushed to the remote repository, while changes stored locally or in the staging area are not.


Video 5 :

Here are the key takeaways from the "Distributed version control" video:

Centralized vs. Distributed: Unlike centralized version control systems (e.g., OneDrive, Dropbox), Git is a distributed version control system.
Complete Repository Copies: In Git, every client has a complete copy of the repository, including all snapshots and the entire history of the files.
Resilience: If something happens to the central server, you still have complete copies of everything that has ever happened to the files on your local machine.


Video 6 :

Here are the key takeaways from the "Use a Codespace for this course" video:

GitHub Codespaces: An online environment with a set configuration that matches the instructor's settings, making it easier to follow along with the course.
Creating Codespaces: You can create a Codespace by forking the LinkedIn Learning repository and using the "Create Codespaces on main" option.
Troubleshooting: If you encounter issues with your Codespace, you can delete it and create a new one to continue following the course.
Video 7 :

Here are the key takeaways from the "Install Git on Windows" video:

Download Git: Visit git-scm.com to download the appropriate Git installer for your operating system.
Installation Process: Follow the Git Setup wizard, which guides you through the installation steps. You can generally accept the default settings.
Verification: After installation, open PowerShell and type git to verify the installation. Use git --version to check the installed version.


Video 8 :

Here are the key takeaways from the "Configure Git" video:

Configuration Files: Git has global and local configuration files. The global config applies to all repositories for your user profile, while the local config applies to a specific repository.
Mandatory Settings: You need to add your name and email to the global configuration using the commands git config --global user.name "Your Name" and git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com".
Viewing Configuration: Use git config --list to view your current settings and ensure they have been added correctly.


Video 9 :

Here are the key takeaways from the "Set up a remote repository" video:

Remote Repository: A remote repository is stored on a Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and can be accessed from anywhere.
Creating a Repository: You can create a new repository on GitHub by visiting github.com/new, choosing a name, and deciding whether it should be public or private.
Initialization Options: When creating a repository, you can initialize it with a README file, a .gitignore file, or a license. Including a README file is a best practice.


Video 10 :

Here are the key takeaways from the "Clone the remote repository" video:

Cloning a Repository: The process involves copying a remote repository to your local device using the git clone command.
HTTPS Method: The video demonstrates using HTTPS for cloning, which is simpler to set up compared to SSH.
Terminal Usage: You can use any terminal (PowerShell, CMD, or terminal on Mac/Linux) to execute the cloning process and open the repository in Visual Studio Code.


Video 11:

Here are the key takeaways from the "Create a file and stage it" video:

Creating a File: You can create any type of file in your repository, and it will be tracked by Git.
Staging a File: Use the git add <file name> command to stage a file, indicating that you want to include it in the next commit.
Git Status: The git status command helps you see the current state of your repository, including which files are staged and ready to be committed.
Video 12 :


Here are the key takeaways from the "Commit a file" video:


Committing Changes: Use the git commit -m "commit message" command to commit staged changes to the local repository, creating a snapshot of the file state.
Commit Message: It's important to include a meaningful commit message that explains the purpose of the commit.
Local vs. Remote: After committing, the changes are stored locally. The next step is to push these changes to the remote repository to synchronize both environments.


Video 13 :


Here are the key takeaways from the "Push the file to the remote repository" video:

Git Push Command: Use the git push command to push changes from your local repository to the remote repository.
Synchronization: This action ensures that your local branch is synchronized with the remote branch.
Verification: After pushing, you can verify the changes by checking the remote repository's web interface to see the updated files and commit messages.
Video 14 :


Here are the key takeaways from the "Pull changes from the remote repository" video:


Pulling Changes: Use the git pull command to update your local repository with changes from the remote repository.
Synchronization: This ensures that your local repository is up-to-date with the latest changes made by others or from another device.
Conflict Handling: Git usually handles merging changes smoothly, even if there are unsaved changes in your local repository.




Video 15 :


Here are the key takeaways from the "Initialize a repository locally and sync it" video:


Creating a Local Repository: Use git init to turn a local folder into a Git repository.
Staging and Committing: Add files to the staging area with git add . and commit them using git commit -m "initial commit".
Connecting to Remote Repository: Link the local repository to a remote one using git remote add origin <URL>.
Pushing Changes: Use git push to push the local commits to the remote repository, following any error instructions to set up the main branch if needed.




Video 16 :


Here are the key takeaways from the "Git status" video:


Overview of Repository State: The git status command provides a clear overview of the current state of your repository, including untracked and staged files.
Next Steps Suggestions: It often suggests what actions to take next, such as using git add to stage files or git push to update the remote repository.
Troubleshooting: The command is useful for troubleshooting and ensuring that your repository is in the desired state.


Video 17 :


Here are the key takeaways from the "Edit a file and view changes" video:


Tracking Changes: Git can track changes within files, not just new files. Use git status to see modified files and git add to stage changes.
Viewing Changes: Use git diff to view changes before committing. It shows a clear overview of differences, highlighting new additions and deletions.
Staging Area: Use git diff --cached to view changes that have been staged but not yet committed.




Video 18 :


Here are the key takeaways from the "Delete files" video:


Deleting Files: When you delete a file in your repository, Git recognizes this change.
Staging and Committing: You need to stage (git add .) and commit (git commit -m "message") the deletion like any other change.
History Retention: Even after deletion, Git retains the file's history, allowing you to recover or reference old versions if needed.






Video 19 :


Here are the key takeaways from the "Rename files" video:


File Renaming: Renaming a file might initially appear as if the old file was deleted and a new one was created. However, once staged, Git recognizes it as a rename.
Git Commands: You can rename a file using git mv <oldname> <newname>, which stages the change automatically, or manually rename and then stage it with git add ..
Commit and Push: After renaming, commit the changes using git commit -m "rename message" and push them to the remote repository to update it.

Here are the key takeaways from the "Rename files" video:


File Renaming: Renaming a file might initially appear as if the old file was deleted and a new one was created. However, once staged, Git recognizes it as a rename.
Git Commands: You can rename a file using git mv <oldname> <newname>, which stages the change automatically, or manually rename and then stage it with git add ..
Commit and Push: After renaming, commit the changes using git commit -m "rename message" and push them to the remote repository to update it.




Video 21 :
Here are the key takeaways from the "Working with folders" video:


Tracking Folders: Git can track folders and their contents. When a file is moved to a new folder, Git recognizes this as a rename rather than a deletion.
Empty Folders: Git does not track empty folders. To ensure an empty folder is tracked, add a .gitkeep file inside it.
Staging and Committing: Use git add . to stage changes and git commit -m "message" to commit them. This includes changes to folders and files.
Video 22 :
Here are the key takeaways from the "Undo your changes" video:


Staging Area Rollback: Use git restore --staged <file> to remove a file from the staging area, moving it back to the working directory.
Discarding Changes: Use git restore . to discard all uncommitted changes, resetting files to their last committed state.
Caution: The git restore command is powerful and can wipe out all uncommitted changes, so use it carefully to avoid losing important work.


Video 23 :
Here are the key takeaways from the "View commit history" video:


Git Log Command: Use git log to view the commit history, which includes commit IDs, author names, dates, and commit messages.
Filtering and Exploring: Commands like git show <commit ID>, git log -p, git log --oneline, and git log --grep='phrase' help filter and explore commit history in different ways.
Graphical Representation: Use git log --graph to visualize branch history and merges.




Video 24 :
Here are the key takeaways from the "Revert a commit" video:


Reverting Changes: You can undo changes by using git revert along with the commit ID. This creates a new commit that undoes the previous changes without rewriting history.
Commit History: Use git log --oneline to view commit history and identify the commit you want to revert.
Best Practices: Reverting is preferred over deleting history to avoid issues when collaborating with others. This ensures a clear record of changes.


These steps help maintain a consistent and accurate project history.


Video 25 :

Here are the key takeaways from the "Ignoring files" video:

Purpose of .gitignore: The .gitignore file is used to tell Git which files or directories to ignore, preventing them from being tracked in the repository.
Usage: You can specify individual files, entire folders, or use wildcards (e.g., *.log) to ignore multiple files with similar patterns.
Limitations: .gitignore only affects files that are not already tracked by Git. To stop tracking an existing file, alternative solutions like making it a template or deleting it are recommended.

These points help you manage which files are included in your Git history, keeping it clean and relevant.

Video 26 :
Here are the key takeaways from the video "The .git folder":

Visibility: The .git folder is hidden by default but can be made visible in Visual Studio Code or your codespace by adjusting user settings.
Contents: This folder contains files that store everything related to your Git repository, including history, metadata, and configuration details.
Caution: While it's okay to look through these files, modifying them can cause Git to stop functioning properly. Deleting the .git folder will remove the repository status from your local folder.

These points help you understand the role and importance of the .git folder in managing your Git repository.

Video 27 :
Here are the key takeaways from the video "Create a branch in your repository":

Branch Creation: A branch is a separate version of your code that allows you to work on new features without affecting the main code. It can be created both locally and in the Git provider.
Workflow: You create a branch using git branch [branch-name] and switch to it with git checkout [branch-name]. This lets you make changes in the new branch while keeping the main branch unchanged.
Pushing to Remote: After making changes, you push the branch to the remote repository using git push --set-upstream origin [branch-name], ensuring the branch exists both locally and remotely.

These points help you understand how to create and manage branches in Git effectively.

Video 28 :

Here are the key takeaways from the video "Create and merge a pull request":

Purpose of a Pull Request: It's used to merge two branches, allowing team members to review, give feedback, and approve changes before merging.
Creating a Pull Request: You can compare changes between branches, add a title and description, and then create the pull request.
Merging and Deleting Branches: Once the pull request is approved, merge it into the main branch and delete the old branch to avoid confusion.

This process ensures code quality and facilitates collaboration, especially in larger projects.

Video 29 :

Here are the key takeaways from the video "Git commit messages":

Descriptive and Present Tense: Commit messages should clearly describe the changes made and be written in the present tense.
Length and Structure: The first line should be no more than 50 characters. If more detail is needed, add a detailed explanation below.
Importance of Clarity: Clear and meaningful commit messages make the Git history easier to understand and maintain.

These practices help in maintaining a clear and understandable project history.

Video 30 :
Here are the key takeaways from the video "Solving a merge conflict":

Cause of Merge Conflicts: Merge conflicts occur when multiple people make changes to the same part of a file and Git doesn't know which version to keep.
Resolving Conflicts: Identify the conflicting changes in your text editor, decide which version to keep (current, incoming, or both), and then save, stage, and commit the resolved file.
Handling Complex Conflicts: For more complex conflicts, take your time to resolve them carefully, and seek online help if needed. If necessary, you can start fresh by recreating your local repository.

These steps help ensure smooth collaboration and code integration in your projects.
